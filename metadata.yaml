description: "The Song of the Lark is the third novel by American author Willa Cather,\
  \ written in 1915. It is generally considered to be the second novel in Cather's\
  \ Prairie Trilogy, following O Pioneers! (1913) and preceding My Ántonia (1918).\n\
  The book tells the story of a talented artist born in a small town in Colorado who\
  \ discovers and develops her singing voice. Her story is told against the backdrop\
  \ of the burgeoning American West in which she was born in a town along the rail\
  \ line, of fast-growing Chicago near the turn of the twentieth century, and of the\
  \ audience for singers of her skills in the US compared to Europe. Thea Kronborg\
  \ grows up, learning herself, her strengths and her talent, until she reaches success.\n\
  The title comes from a painting of the same name by Jules Breton in 1884 and part\
  \ of the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
